# Basic Shopping App
This app is developed with React Native. In the application, the data is pulled from the internet with the axios package. Pulling is done with Custom Hooks.
I use the Custom Hooks structure that I use on the main page on the Detail page. I draw detailed information of the product with Custom Hook.
